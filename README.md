# mmessier

## Summary

- This is a react monorepo where I'll be:
  - Publishing npm modules for anyone's use
  - Managing personal web application projects
  - Building up highly extensible component libraries

## Application TODOs

- mmessier
  - Use the query parameter hook to ingest locations from which guests come and visit your website
    - It may be interesting to personalize the experience of the site in some way based on the location the user came from, or have a database or serve that gets incremented based on the source
  - Figure out a way to host this website via Next.js, primarily doing server-side rendering
